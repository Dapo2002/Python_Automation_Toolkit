 Chapter 15: PDF & Word Document Automation

This module focuses on the programmatic manipulation of binary document formats. It demonstrates the ability to automate security protocols, perform recursive file operations, and generate stylized business documents at scale.

 🚀 Key Features

 🔐 PDF Paranoia (Security Suite)
- Recursive Encryption: Traverses directory trees to find and password-protect PDFs.
- Integrity Verification: Uses a "verify-before-delete" protocol, ensuring encrypted copies are functional before removing unencrypted sources.
- Batch Decryption: A recursive tool to restore access to all encrypted files within a folder structure.

 🔨 Brute-Force Password Cracker
- Dictionary Attack: Implements a dictionary-based attack against PDF encryption.
- Heuristic Variations: Automatically tests over 88,000 combinations, including case-insensitive variations (Uppercase/Lowercase).
- Optimized Logic: Features immediate exit upon successful decryption to conserve CPU cycles.

 ✉️ Custom Invitation Generator
- Mail Merge Automation: Reads guest lists from external `.txt` files to generate personalized Word documents.
- Dynamic Styling: Applies custom Word styles and programmatic page breaks (`WD_BREAK.PAGE`) to ensure print-readiness.

 🛠️ Requirements & Stack
- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2: For PDF encryption, decryption, and metadata handling.
- python-docx: For manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of `.docx` files.
- File I/O: For processing dictionary files and guest lists.

 📁 Repository Structure
- `PDFParanoia.py`: The main encryption/decryption engine.
- `bruteForcePDF.py`: The dictionary-based attack script.
- `customInvitations.py`: The Word document generator.
- `dictionary.txt`: The reference wordlist for security testing.
